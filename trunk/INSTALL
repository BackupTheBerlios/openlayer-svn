INSTALLATION

Before compiling ensure you have the following installed and in your path:
- GNU compiler tools (ie gcc/g++, make, etc)
- OpenGL Library
- Allegro Library
- AllegroGL Library
- Freetype library version 2.1.10 or greater. Anything else and it won't work.
- GlyphKeeper library specifically built for ALLEGROGL
	- the allegrogl version should be named libglyph-agl.a
	- The sources have now been included with openlayer in the utils/glyphkeeper directory
	- run ./cbuild.c glyphkeeper and it will build the library and ask you where you want to install it
- Png library
- LoadPng library 1.4 pre1 
	- Loadpng must be the 1.4 pre1 release anything before that WILL not work
	- The library is included in the utils directory run ./cbuild.c loadpng to build it and ask you where you want to install it
- Zlib library

BUILDING:

The build utility is known as cbuild which openlayer uses, for more information go to http://awiki.tomasu.org/bin/view/Main/CBUILD

For those on windows without msys, but have mingw please use the batch file "buildme.bat" instead.
Substitute 'buildme' for './cbuild.c' below.

To print help:
Type './cbuild.c help' in the root directory of OpenLayer

To override previous configuration:
Append 'configuration' when you are calling 'cbuild.c'

To disable supressed output:
Append 'verbose' when you are calling 'cbuild.c'

To compile:
Type './cbuild.c' in the root directory of OpenLayer
This will do the following:
	- Prompt you for your desired platform
        - Prompt for support options
	- Saves previous configuration for use later
	- Create the library and place it in the lib folder  (lib/libopenlayer.a)
	- Create several demos of the library in the demos folder (need to fix)

To clean up resources and remove the built library and resources:
Type './cbuild.c clean' in the root directory of OpenLayer

To install:
Type './cbuild.c install' in the root directory of OpenLayer
This will prompt you for a location for install.

To uninstall:
Type './cbuild.c uninstall' in the root directory of OpenLayer
This should automatically uninstall the previous install.
If no installation data is found, it will prompt you for the installation location.

FOR COMPILERS OTHER THAN GCC

- MSVC compilation support should be added later on

- For precompiled versions of the library please see 
  http://openlayer.berlios.de for more info.

- If no package exists for your compiler you'll have to compile OpenLayer's source files and
  include them in the same archive. Also download the required external libraries and follow the
  installation instructions included with them.


To Use:

- Read the provided documentation found in the Manual folder to know how to use the library

- #include <OpenLayer.hpp> in your project's sources

	LINUX/*NIX and MACOSX
- Link your projects with: `openlayer-config --libs` if you need the flags do `openlayer-config --cflags`
	
	WINDOWS
- Link your projects with:
	"-lopenlayer -lglyph-agl -lfreetype -lldpng -lpng -lz -lagl -lalleg -luser32 -lgdi32 -lglu32-lopengl32"
