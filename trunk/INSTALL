INSTALLATION

Before compiling ensure you have the following installed and in your path:
- GNU compiler tools (ie gcc/g++, make, etc)
- OpenGL Library
- Allegro Library
- AllegroGL Library
- Freetype library version 2.1.10 or greater. Anything else and it won't work.
- GlyphKeeper library specifically built for ALLEGROGL
	- the allegrogl version should be named libglyph-agl.a
	- Attached is a makefile (under utils) to create the allegrogl verision with glyphkeeper 0.29.1
	- Note that GK 0.29.1 will have 2 compile errors in glyph_to_opengl. Either remove the comments
	  or change // to /* with it's closing */ brace
- Png library
- LoadPng library 1.4 pre1 
	- Loadpng must be the 1.4 pre1 release anything before that WILL not work
	- The library is included in the utils directory run 'make loadpng' to build it and follow the instructions to install
- Zlib library

GNU/MINGW

To compile:
Type 'make TARGET=platform' in the root directory of OpenLayer
You must specify the target platform like:
	LINUX
	make TARGET=LINUX
	
	WINDOWS
	make TARGET=WINDOWS
	
	MACOSX
	make TARGET=MACOSX
	
This will do the following:
	- Create the library and place it in the lib folder  (lib/libopenlayer.a)
	- Create several demos of the library in the demos folder

To clean up resources and remove the built library and demos:
Type 'make clean' in the root directory of OpenLayer

To install:
Type 'make install LOCATION=/path' in the root directory of OpenLayer
You must specify "LOCATION" with the path to where a lib and include directory exist
or else it will not install.
EXAMPLES:
	LINUX (must be root or with write permissions)
	make TARGET=LINUX install LOCATION=/usr
	
	WINDOWS
	make TARGET=WINDOWS install LOCATION=c:\dev-cpp
	
	MACOSX
	make TARGET=MACOSX install LOCATION=/usr

To uninstall:
Type 'make uninstall INSTALL_LOCATION' in the root directory of OpenLayer
You must specify "INSTALL_LOCATION" with the path to where OpenLayer was installed.
EXAMPLES:
	LINUX (must be root or with write permissions)
	make TARGET=LINUX uninstall INSTALL_LOCATION=/usr
	
	WINDOWS
	make TARGET=WINDOWS uninstall INSTALL_LOCATION=c:\dev-cpp
	
	MACOSX
	make TARGET=MACOSX uninstall INSTALL_LOCATION=/usr

FOR COMPILERS OTHER THAN GCC
 
- For precompiled versions of the library please see 
  http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/openlayer/ for more info.

- If no package exists for your compiler you'll have to compile OpenLayer's source files and
  include them in the same archive. Also download the required external libraries and follow the
  installation instructions included with them.


To Use:

- Read the provided documentation found in the Manual folder to know how to use the library

- #include <OpenLayer.hpp> in your project's sources

	LINUX
- Link your projects with:
	"-lopenlayer -lglyph-agl -lfreetype -lldpng -lpng -lz -lagl `allegro-config --libs` -lGL -lGLU"
	
	WINDOWS
- Link your projects with:
	"-lopenlayer -lglyph-agl -lfreetype -lldpng -lpng -lz -lagl -lalleg -luser32 -lgdi32 -lglu32-lopengl32"
	
	MACOSX
- Link your projects with:
	"-lopenlayer -lglyph-agl -lfreetype -lldpng -lpng -lz -lagl `allegro-config --libs` -framework OpenGL -framework Carbon"
